# PLUMED Metadynamics

Well-tempered metadynamics deposits Gaussian hills along chosen collective variables (CVs),
discouraging revisits and gradually recovering the free energy surface. Unlike umbrella sampling,
no windows are needed — the bias adapts on-the-fly. The key trade-off is CV quality: a poor CV
produces a heavily biased ensemble that is hard to reweight.

Assumes a GROMACS-patched PLUMED installation; see `gmx-install` skill if needed.
Start from an NPT-equilibrated system; see `gmx-prep` for those stages.

## Information to Collect

**Before generating any input files, ask the user:**

1. **CV type**: What describes the slow degree of freedom?
   - Torsion / dihedral? → atom indices or MOLINFO shortcut
   - RMSD from one reference state? → reference PDB file (suitable for folding, binding)
   - Two RMSDs (2D)? → two reference PDB files (two-state transitions)
   - Custom / path-based? → FUNC= expression and constituent CVs
2. **Reference structure(s)**: PDB file for MOLINFO and/or RMSD CVs
3. **Secondary CVs to monitor** (not biased, but printed to COLVAR for analysis)
4. **System temperature** T (K) — needed for `kBT`, reweighting, and BIASFACTOR choice
5. **BIASFACTOR** (γ): ratio of exploration temperature to system temperature
   - Small barriers (< 10 kBT): γ = 5–15
   - Large barriers (> 20 kBT): γ = 30–60
6. **SIGMA**: Gaussian width ≈ std-dev of CV in short unbiased run (run Stage 1 first)
   - Typical: 0.1–0.4 rad for torsions; 0.05 nm for RMSD
7. **Grid bounds** GRID_MIN/MAX: physical CV range (must enclose all relevant states)
8. **PACE**: Gaussian deposition interval in MD steps (default 500 = 1 ps at dt=0.002)
9. **Simulation length** (nsteps)
10. **PBC handling**: For RMSD or distance CVs, does the molecule cross periodic boundaries?
    (If yes, add `WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0=FIRST_ATOM-LAST_ATOM` before CV definitions.)

## Stage 1: Unbiased run + sigma estimation

Run a short unbiased simulation to observe CV fluctuations.

```bash
gmx mdrun -plumed plumed_unbiased.dat -s topol.tpr -nsteps 200000 -x traj_unbiased.xtc
```

```python
import plumed, numpy as np

colvar = plumed.read_as_pandas("colvar.dat")
cv1 = colvar["cv1"]

print(f"CV range visited: [{cv1.min():.3f}, {cv1.max():.3f}]")
print(f"Suggested SIGMA = {cv1.std():.3f}  (std-dev from unbiased run)")
print(f"Suggested GRID_MIN/MAX: [{cv1.min() - 3*cv1.std():.3f}, {cv1.max() + 3*cv1.std():.3f}]")
```

**Verify:** CV samples a finite range and is not stuck; std-dev is physically reasonable.

---

## Stage 2: Metadynamics simulation

Choose the template that matches your CV type and fill in parameters from Stage 1.

```bash
gmx mdrun -plumed plumed_metad_CVTYPE.dat -s topol.tpr -nsteps NSTEPS -x traj.xtc
```

Monitor progress:
```bash
tail -f COLVAR   # watch CV evolving; should diffuse broadly after a while
wc -l HILLS      # growing HILLS file confirms Gaussians are being deposited
```

**Verify:** CV explores significantly more space than the unbiased run; HILLS file is non-empty.

---

## Stage 3: Free energy surface from sum_hills

```bash
# Compute FES at STRIDE-step intervals for convergence assessment
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS --stride STRIDE_FOR_FES --mintozero

# Output: fes_0.dat, fes_1.dat, ..., fes_N.dat
# Each file has columns: cv1 [cv2] fes [sigma]
```

```python
import plumed, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, glob

fes_files = sorted(glob.glob("fes_*.dat"),
                   key=lambda f: int(f.split("_")[1].split(".")[0]))

for fname in fes_files[-5:]:  # plot last 5 snapshots
    d = plumed.read_as_pandas(fname).dropna()
    plt.plot(d.iloc[:, 0], d.iloc[:, 1], label=fname)

plt.xlabel("CV"); plt.ylabel("F (kJ/mol)")
plt.legend(); plt.show()

# Quantify convergence: track ΔF between two basins
# Ask user to identify approximate basin boundaries from the FES plot
```

**Verify:** FES changes slowly between snapshots near the end of the simulation.

---

## Stage 4: Reweighting (unbiased projection)

Reweighting lets you project the unbiased FES onto any CV, including ones not biased.

```bash
# Run plumed driver on the production trajectory
plumed driver --plumed plumed_reweight.dat --ixtc traj.xtc
```

The reweight template (RESTART=YES, HEIGHT=0) reads the existing HILLS file and computes
`REWEIGHT_BIAS` logweights, which are used to produce unbiased histograms.

```python
import plumed, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = plumed.read_as_pandas("COLVAR_REWEIGHT")
cv1 = np.array(data["cv1"])
bias = np.array(data["metad.bias"])

kBT = TEMPERATURE * 8.314462618e-3
bmax = bias.max()
logW = (bias - bmax) / kBT
W = np.exp(logW)

# Weighted histogram → FES
bins = np.linspace(CV1_MIN, CV1_MAX, N_BINS + 1)
hist, edges = np.histogram(cv1, bins=bins, weights=W, density=True)
centers = 0.5 * (edges[:-1] + edges[1:])
fes = -kBT * np.log(hist + 1e-300)
fes -= fes.min()

plt.plot(centers, fes)
plt.xlabel("CV"); plt.ylabel("F (kJ/mol)")
plt.show()
```

**Verify:** Reweighted FES matches sum_hills FES in qualitative features.

---

## Stage 5: Block analysis (error estimation)

Divide the trajectory into blocks and compute free energy variance as a function of block size.
A plateau in the error curve indicates that blocks are statistically independent.

Prepare a weight file from `COLVAR_REWEIGHT`:
```python
import plumed, numpy as np

data = plumed.read_as_pandas("COLVAR_REWEIGHT")
kBT = TEMPERATURE * 8.314462618e-3
bias = np.array(data["metad.bias"])
logW = (bias - bias.max()) / kBT

with open("cv.weight", "w") as f:
    for cv_val, lw in zip(data["cv1"], logW):
        f.write(f"{cv_val:.6f} {lw:.6f}\n")
```

Run the block analysis script for multiple block sizes:
```bash
for bs in 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000; do
    python3 templates/do_block_fes.py cv.weight 1 CV1_MIN CV1_MAX N_BINS KBT ${bs}
done
```

Plot results:
```python
import numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, glob

block_sizes, errors = [], []
for bs in [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000]:
    try:
        d = np.loadtxt(f"fes.{bs}.dat")
        # Average error over the FES (exclude infinite/NaN values)
        err = np.nanmean(d[:, 2][np.isfinite(d[:, 2])])
        block_sizes.append(bs)
        errors.append(err)
    except Exception:
        pass

plt.semilogx(block_sizes, errors, "o-")
plt.xlabel("Block size (frames)"); plt.ylabel("Mean error (kJ/mol)")
plt.title("Block analysis — plateau indicates convergence")
plt.show()
```

**Verify:** Error plateaus before block size = total trajectory length / 2.

---

## Stage 6: Convergence assessment

Combine Stage 3 and Stage 5 diagnostics:
- Plot ΔF between basins as a function of simulation time (from sum_hills output)
- Compare the magnitude of ΔF fluctuations to the block analysis plateau error

**If FES is still drifting**: CV is insufficient for the process, or simulation is too short.
Consider adding dimensions, switching to a better CV, or using `plumed-remd`.

**If FES converged but block error is large**: Simulation sampled the right space but
autocorrelation is long. Run longer, or use replica methods.

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| HILLS grows but FES does not change | Grid too coarse or too fine | Adjust GRID_SPACING; must be < SIGMA |
| Bias diverges / system explodes | HEIGHT too large or BIASFACTOR too small | Reduce HEIGHT; increase BIASFACTOR |
| RMSD diverges to large values | Molecule wraps across PBC | Add `WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0=ATOM_RANGE`; use TYPE=OPTIMAL |
| Reweighted FES differs strongly from sum_hills FES | RESTART=YES missing | Add `RESTART=YES` to METAD in reweight template |
| Block error never plateaus | Trajectory too short or CV poor | Run longer; check that multiple barrier crossings occurred |
| sum_hills: grid too small | CV visited outside GRID_MIN/MAX | Rerun with wider grid; PLUMED deposits outside grid but cannot reconstruct FES there |

## Working Examples (alanine dipeptide)

The `templates/examples/` directory contains working PLUMED input files from PLUMED Masterclass 21.4,
using alanine dipeptide in vacuum with backbone torsion angles as CVs.
Use these as a reference for syntax; adapt CV definitions for your own system.

- `plumed_ex1.dat` — Unbiased MD, MOLINFO + torsion CVs
- `plumed_ex2.dat` — 1D well-tempered METAD
- `plumed_ex3.dat` — Reweighting (RESTART=YES, COLVAR_REWEIGHT)
- `plumed_ex4.dat` — REWEIGHT_BIAS + HISTOGRAM + CONVERT_TO_FES + DUMPGRID

Run example (requires `data/diala/topolA.tpr` and `data/diala/dialaA.pdb`):
```bash
gmx mdrun -plumed templates/examples/plumed_ex1.dat \
          -s data/diala/topolA.tpr -nsteps 200000
```
